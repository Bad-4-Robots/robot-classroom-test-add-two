# Adding Two Numbers Assignment

This is a simple programming assignment where you need to implement a function that adds two numbers together.

## Task Description

Your task is to implement the `add_two_numbers` function in the `add_numbers.py` file. The function should:

1. Take two parameters `a` and `b` of type float
2. Return their sum as a float
3. Handle both positive and negative numbers
4. Handle decimal numbers correctly

The function signature is already provided:

```python
def add_two_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install pytest if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

## Implementation

Open `add_numbers.py` and implement the `add_two_numbers` function. Remove the `raise NotImplementedError` line and write your implementation.
